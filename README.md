# Heart Disease Detection

This project uses Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to detect the risk of heart disease based on various health factors.

## Project Overview

In this project, the goal was to identify key risk factors for heart disease (such as high cholesterol, age, and high blood pressure) and develop a model to predict the likelihood of heart disease occurrence.

## Key Steps Involved

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
   - Conducted EDA to identify key features influencing heart disease risk.
   - Analyzed the relationship between various health factors and the likelihood of developing heart disease.
   - Visualized trends using **Python**, with libraries such as **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

2. **Correlation Analysis**: 
   - Identified a strong correlation between **high cholesterol**, **age**, and **high blood pressure** with the likelihood of heart disease.

3. **Visualization**: 
   - Visualized the key trends and patterns using graphs and plots to better understand the dataset and make informed decisions on predictive modeling.

## Tools Used

- **Jupyter Notebook**: For writing and executing Python code.
- **Python**: Programming language used for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **Seaborn**: A statistical data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib.

## Results

Through data analysis, I found significant correlations between several factors like cholesterol levels, age, and blood pressure with the likelihood of developing heart disease.
